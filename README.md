# Salary-Predictions-of-Data-Professions

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE 
To analyze and predict the salaries of data professionals based on a variety of factors such as experience, education, job role, and location. By employing SQL for data manipulation and querying, the goal was to uncover patterns and correlations that can help job seekers, employers, and industry analysts make informed decisions regarding salary expectations and offers.

## SQL QUERIES AND TECHNIQUES USED :
#### Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers.
#### Aggregation functions to summarize data and identify trends.
#### JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.
#### Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex querying.
#### Window functions to calculate running totals, moving averages, and rank data.

This project not only honed my SQL skills but also provided valuable insights into the factors that drive salary variations in the data profession.
